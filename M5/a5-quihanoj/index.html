                        The <strong>index</strong> as it relates to websites and servers is the URL or the local file if running on a local server that loads when the web browser starts. Essentially, the index is the default webpage that is shown if no other page is specified when a user requests a site. Through the exploration sections, index.html is used when explaining many examples. Index.html is the designated homepage on the web server. It serves as a great base for explaining front-end web concepts and conveys to the user where many webpages will default to when initially visited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen. What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server versus the local computer? -->
                        The difference between checking the file details on the web server versus on a local computer is first the URL. When viewing the file on a local computer the user will see the request URL contains an IP address but when viewing the file that was transferred to the server is shows the web server's URL and path. The response and request headers are also very different. The website network tab on a local computer includes many different response and request headers, while the file hosted on the web server display fewer headers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not. -->
                        The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file has a status of 200 because the file exists and is linked in the HTML file. The other files are empty and are not referred to in the file. The code displayed for main.js and main.css is 404 which means that the requested files are not found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What is the scheme, the subdomain, the host domain, and the resources? -->
                        The parts of the URL are the <strong>scheme</strong>, which depending on which "server" it is being run on would be either HTTP for the locally ran file or file for the website hosted on the web server. The <strong>subdomain</strong> will also differ, as the locally ran file displays the user's IP address while the hosted file displays the Oregon State University file server subdomain stak.engr. The <strong>host domain</strong> for the local file is somewhat hard to decipher since it is locally hosted and the IP address serves as the subdomain and the host domain. While the file that is on the web server does show oregonstate.edu, which we can see is the host domain. Lastly, the resources which we can see are separated by the forward slashes. With the local file, we can see that the slashes are followed by the user's parent folder name, followed by the nested folder and finally the index.html file. The file on the web server also display a folder structure which is slightly deeper. The folder structure starts with a user parent folder, followed by the user's OSU ENGR ID, the nested folder file name and finally the index.html file.

                        <!-- concept of frontend design -->
                        The concept of frontend design is about creating an appropriate experience for the users. This includes the visual design of the page, creating visually pleasing and a consistent them for the website. A well-thought-out color scheme, fonts and layouts that align with the purpose of the website. The color of a website plays a significant role in frontend design. It can improve readability, evoke emotions and create balance for the user's visual experience. Fonts or typography is essential for readability. The choice of fonts will not only impact how the user will perceive the webpages content, but will enhance the user's overall experience. Media such as videos, images and animations are used to present and convey information. The media elements should be optimized and have fast loading times to avoid user dissatisfaction. The GUI and navigation are critical for guiding users through a website. It should make it easy for users to access the information that they need. Intuitive buttons, menus and interactive elements should be created with the intended audience in mind.

                    <!-- the purpose of each page layout tags -->
                    The header element <strong>&#60header&#62</strong> denotes the banner of an app/site. It will typically contain the name, publisher or a marketing slogan. The nav element <strong>&#60nav&#62</strong> may be used multiple times on a website or app. Each section of the navigation element takes the user from the current page to another page. The <strong>&#60section&#62</strong> tag is used to group related content. The first child of the section will usually be the <strong>&#60h1&#62</strong> tag that describes what the section contains, followed by related content. The section tag should only be used if all content is related. The <strong>&#60article&#62</strong> tag is typically used inside a section and denotes a single specific topic with the title using a h2 tag. Multiple articles will usually have a unique ID selector, so they can be styled separately. The <strong>&#60footer&#62</strong> tag resides towards the bottom of the HTML document, sitting right below the closing <strong>&#60/main&#62</strong> tag. This will usually hold the legal information, contact information and links to critical pages. Lastly, the <strong>&#60div&#62</strong> tag is a placeholder for dynamic content and can be used to divide content.

                    <li>
                        <strong>External Anchors</strong> link to external content by providing the URL in the <strong>&#60a href="--URL HERE--"&#62</strong> href area of the anchor tag. When the link is  clicked on, it will redirect the user to the website referenced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Internal Anchors</strong> link to internal content on the same page by using the ID selectors that are used on the related object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using anchor tags to navigate from page to page can be done by referencing the filename within the anchor href selector. For example, navigating from a contact page to a home page the anchor tag could reflect <strong>&#60a href="index.html"&#62</strong>. Which would redirect the user from the contact page back to the home page.

                        <strong>Descriptive file name</strong> - The file names should include who, what, where and when as much as possible. The descriptive and concise file names will help with search engine bots to categorize it for users who are searching for related images.<strong>Small file size</strong> - Reducing file sizes will help with faster loading times. High resolution images should only be served to high resolution devices. Lossless compression should be used to avoid loss of data and image pixelation. Smaller image files are essential to ensure fast loading times, better image quality and a better user experience. <strong>Exact dimensions</strong> - Cropping and reducing the size of images to fit the space within a webpage will reduce load time for images and increasing the user experience. <strong>Correct file format</strong> - The correct extension for using photos online is .JPG, line-art images such as logos, icons or vectors are usually .GIF or 8-bit.PNG. Graphics with true transparency need to be 24-bit .PNG. Using the correct file format on media will result in the best overall user experience, faster load times and website performance. <strong>Reduced resolution</strong> - Depending on the monitor, resolution can render between 72 or 300+ pixels per inch. Using reduced resolution will result in faster loading times, improved page performance and mobile friendliness. Being that many users access pages via their mobile devices this is an important factor when adding images to a website. <strong>Color Mode</strong> - RGB should be used for .PNG, .JPG, .SVG and .WebP and Indexed for .GIF and sometimes .PNG. Color mode is important for images on webpages because it affects the user experience and how the images are displayed. Consistent color profiles should be maintained to ensure images are displayed properly across browsers on various devices.
                        <p>
                        The most appropriate file formats for photos are either <strong>.JPG</strong> and <strong>.WebP</strong> because photos typically have a multitude of colors, various details and taken with high resolution cameras. These file formats have good compression with minimal loss of quality, along with being supported widely by devices and web browsers.
                        The most common file formats for line art on the web are <strong>.GIF, .PNG,</strong> and <strong>.SVG.</strong> <strong>SVGs</strong> are ideal for vectors, logos and simple images. They are highly scalable, file sizes are typically small and has minimal loss of quality. <strong>PNGs</strong> are ideal for line art, solid colors and biomorphic shapes. Images should use the .PNG extension when high quality is required and utilize Lossless compression. The <strong>GIF</strong> extension is typically used and is suitable for simple animations or 8-bit images with minimal color variations. GIFs are important on websites to contribute to the overall user experience and evoke emotions as users navigate the website.

                        Browsers and Devices use <strong>Favicons</strong> in various ways, one being to enhance the user experience. Favicons provide a user with a visual representation of a website or web application. Browsers display a favicon in the tab when a user visits the website, which provide the user a way to identify a tab when multiple tabs are being used. Favicons are also useful when the website is bookmarked, the favicon will display in the user's toolbar and allows a user to quickly recognize the site on the bar. Essentially, favicons provide a useful but simple icon that allow the user to identify and associate an icon with a brand, website or application.

                        The main reasons to incorporate <strong>stylesheets</strong>> in websites and apps are because it contributes to the overall user experience. The visual appearance of a website or application plays an important role. Stylesheets ensure that a webiste or application enable responsive design, an important feature that allows responsiveness on various devices. They also provide a consistent design throught the website or application. Implementing standard typography, colors and other details across the website or app create a uniform feel for the user. Essentially <strong>stylesheets</strong> help to create a sleek, visually appealing experience for a website or application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5 ways to incorporate styles are by, firstly using an <strong>External Stylesheet</strong>. This can be done by using a &#60link&#62 in the global &#60head&#62 area of the webiste; &#60link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css&#62. Other stylesheets can also be imported @import "normalize.css";. Using external stylesheets are generally a best practice when adding styling to a website or application. A second way to incorporate styles is by using <strong>Embedded</strong> styles within the HTML file. This can be done by using a &#60style&#62 tag and referencing the selector that you would like to add styling to. Next the third way to incorporate style is using <strong>Inline</strong> styling. This can be done by directly writing the style within the selector. An example of this is <strong>&#60h1 style="color:pink"&#62</strong>. Using embedded or inline styling is generally not recommended since we would like to use seperation of concerns. Meaning that keeping CSS styling and HTML in their appropriate files will make it easier to manage and update. As applications get larger writing styling directly in an HTML file can cause bugs and become a debugging nightmare. The other 2 ways to incorporate styles involve using JavaScript. First utilizing <strong>Template Literals</strong>, template literals define a variable and assign a value that can drectly modify a selector. The second method involving JavaScript is the <strong>Document Object Model(DOM)</strong>. Utilizing the DOM and JavaScript code it can modifying the styling of an element. For example changing the color of an element of click or using an event listener to do some type of action. Using JavaScript for styling adds another layer of complexity can add value to a website and increase the user experience.
